## [6.0.0] - 2021-11-03

### Added
- PHP 8 support
- `OxidEsales\GraphQL\Base\DataType\ShopModelAwareInterface` intended to be implemented by DataTypes related to a `OxidEsales\Eshop\Core\Model\BaseModel`
- Token service `OxidEsales\GraphQL\Base\Service\Token` for accessing current token
- User DataType `OxidEsales\GraphQL\Base\DataType\User` in place of former `OxidEsales\GraphQL\Base\Framework\UserData` and `OxidEsales\GraphQL\Base\Framework\AnonymousUserData` classes
  - It holds an instance of `OxidEsales\Eshop\Application\Model\User` which it tries to actually load. For an anonymous user there will be no record in the database, so `OxidEsales\Eshop\Application\Model\User::isLoaded()` will be false in this case.
  - Implements the `OxidEsales\GraphQL\Base\DataType\ShopModelAwareInterface`
- File upload handling
  - Used the special fork of `Ecodev/graphql-upload`, which supports PHP8 and `webonyx/graphql-php ^0.13` to fit other components
- `OxidEsales\GraphQL\Base\Framework\Constraint\BelongsToShop` token validation constraint
- `OxidEsales\GraphQL\Base\Service\JwtConfigurationBuilder` to handle everything related to JWT token configuration.
- Token lifetime is configurable via module setting (default 8 hours) and checked during token validation.
- Added method `OxidEsales\GraphQL\Base\Service\ModuleConfiguration::getTokenLifeTime()`

### Changed
- Updated to `thecodingmachine/graphqlite ^4.0` and `lcobucci/jwt ^4.0`
- `Lcobucci\JWT\Token` cannot be used directly anymore, changed to UnencryptedToken interface everywhere
- DataType directory contents has been restructured to: Filter, Pagination, Sorting
- Improved `OxidEsales\GraphQL\Base\Service\Authentication`
  - `TheCodingMachine\GraphQLite\Security\AuthenticationServiceInterface` is now fully implemented
  - Extracted token creation to `OxidEsales\GraphQL\Base\Service\Token` service
  - Extracted token validation to `OxidEsales\GraphQL\Base\Service\TokenValidator` service
    - Token validation is done once during token reading procedure now
    - Checking if token user is in "blocked" group is done here as well
- Logic changes as `OxidEsales\GraphQL\Base\Framework\NullToken` has been removed. Token may be available or not, no stable default states anymore.
- Tests readability improved greatly
- `OxidEsales\GraphQL\Base\Framework\ModuleSetup` class moved to `OxidEsales\GraphQL\Base\Infrastructure\ModuleSetup`
- Renamed `OxidEsales\GraphQL\Base\Service\KeyRegistry` to `OxidEsales\GraphQL\Base\Service\ModuleConfiguration`

### Removed
- PHP 7.3 support
- Removed framework classes
  - `OxidEsales\GraphQL\Base\Framework\UserData`
  - `OxidEsales\GraphQL\Base\Framework\AnonymousUserData`
  - `OxidEsales\GraphQL\Base\Framework\NullToken`
- Removed deprecated `OxidEsales\GraphQL\Base\Service\Legacy`
